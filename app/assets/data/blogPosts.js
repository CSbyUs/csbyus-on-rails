          summary: `As a Computer Science major at Duke and a teaching assistant for our Data Structures and Algorithms class, I feel that I have the opportunity to witness firsthand the way that exposure to computer science prior to college can affect students’ learning. For students without prior experience, there can be a steep learning curve when they get to college, and it is worsened by the fact that some of their peers have known the basics for years.

`As a Computer Science major at Duke and a teaching assistant for our Data Structures and Algorithms class, I feel that I have the opportunity to witness firsthand the way that exposure to computer science prior to college can affect students’ learning. For students without prior experience, there can be a steep learning curve when they get to college, and it is worsened by the fact that some of their peers have known the basics for years. This problem exists for all, but is especially prevalent for historically underrepresented groups in computing, such as women and people of color. With this blog post, I’m going to analyze exactly why we see this difference in prior experience and the long-term effects of a lack of early CS education and discuss how our team, CSByUs, is trying to combat this.

As we go through the life of a student, I want you to keep in mind the analogy of the leaky STEM pipeline, a phenomenon commonly used to describe the loss of STEM students and workers as they progress through their education. This analogy hinges on the fact that at younger ages, people are interested in STEM fields, but over time, they go on to pursue other majors in college or careers upon graduating. To give an example, we can analyze The Chronicle’s discussion of women in computer science classes over time found here: https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2017/12/why-women-dont-stick-with-tech. For CS 101, an introductory class, the statistics are approximately half and half for men and women. The percentage of women drops about 10% for CS 201, the data structures and algorithms class. By the time students reach CS 230, a class required for the computer science major, the percentage drops to only about ¼ females. Even during the course of three computer science classes, the STEM pipeline experiences some pretty significant leaks. This implies that for some reason, when looking at higher level computer science classes, more and more women decide to stop pursuing computer science as a major. Why is this? As a female in computer science, I would probably say that it is a self-reinforcing problem. As I see less and less women in my CS classes, I become less and less motivated myself. This causes more women to drop CS, which in turn hurts others’ motivations. To fix this, it is necessary to provide support for underrepresented groups in CS to prevent this feeling of inadequacy and desire to drop out. But how do we even begin to approach that?

One of the main sources of this problem is the education gap, which is heavily tied into privilege. Our team read a chapter of "Stuck In the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing" by Jane Margolis in which she analyzes the way that privilege and race affect stigma and accessibility of computer science education. During her paper, she categorizes schools as privileged and underprivileged. Privileged schools are generally defined to be those with more funding, better resources, and more skilled teachers, whereas underprivileged schools are in poorer areas, have less funding, and a significant lack of resources compared to other schools. Margolis found that in less privileged high schools, the teachers were less likely to be skilled in CS education and encourage students to pursue the field. Additionally, these schools also had less classes and equipment that was older and occasionally didn’t even work. This left many students feeling dissatisfied with their experience and unmotivated to continue on in the field. I believe that this lack of resources for certain groups directly influences what they pursue when they reach college or the workforce.

Margolis also took note that there was a certain stigma surrounding computer science students. For example, many students reported that a computer science student looked like a "white or asian nerdy guy" or similar descriptors. Because this typical description of a CS student is so limiting, many other individuals feel as if they are not cut out to be in CS because they don’t match a certain demographic. This directly correlates to some of our critically identified problems as a team: access and personal relevance. Access refers to general geography, access to money, and access to better resources/teachers. Personal relevance refers to students who feel disinterested in CS because the problems commonly discussed aren’t relevant to all groups.

In order to combat this, our team believes that it is necessary to create accessible and relatable CS education for all students starting at a young age. In doing this, it is possible to boost interest for younger students while also facilitating equality and breaking the stigma before it is even developed. We believe that we can maintain higher percentages of computer science students regardless of their demographic and even out the percentages of various groups in CS. By this point, you may be wondering why it even matters. Colleges give out plenty of CS degrees, we have CS workers, so why do we care? Well, it isn’t always that simple.

Going back to our leaky STEM pipeline, it is necessary to address the fact that although we have many CS majors, we don’t necessarily have enough members in the CS workforce. Those that we do have are very uniform, and fit closely within the confines of the aforementioned CS stereotype. In the United States, a large portion of professional careers is dedicated to STEM. However, there are not enough educated employees to fill these careers. For example, according to Jonathan Rothwell’s article "Short on STEM Talent," there are four million job vacancies in the computer science field, but there are only 40,000 Bachelor’s degrees in computer science earned annually. This is especially a problem noted for senior positions within CS. Although we seem to have many students studying computer science, it is a constantly growing field, and we want to continue supporting that growth.

Looking forward, I hope that one day Computer Science education can be accessible for all, and that we can remove the stigma surrounding studying CS. I think that with enough work on our part, we can encourage people from all backgrounds to study CS early on, which will in turn help lessen the steep learning curve in college and boost the STEM workforce as a whole. So far, we have already made a lot of progress toward this through teaching at schools in the local Durham community. During our lesson plans, students create apps with content that they choose, learn about fundamental concepts such as variables and algorithms, and more!

`There are many challenges plaguing the field of computer science education today, including issues of unequal access, teacher bias, and lack of qualified teachers. While some of these can be remedied more easily than others, great progress has been made in recent years to close these gaps and make computer science a field open to all. In spite of recent strides, a significant problem that persists is the need for a computer science curriculum that makes computer science feel relevant and comprehensible to all, regardless of background or academic interests. Even those who may not pursue a career in computer science can benefit from the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that computer science teaches. In addition, as technology becomes more deeply integrated in many facets of everyday life, computer literacy is becoming increasingly necessary, and these persistent problems in computer science education remain concerning. In order to address these issues, Duke undergraduates founded CSbyUs, a student-led initiative focused on broadening access to quality computer science education and igniting future change agents to transform their communities with tools developed through computer science education. There are three main components to this initiative: curriculum development, teaching, and technology development. I chose to join the teaching and technology teams because, as a computer science major and an education minor, I am passionate about both the importance of computer science education and the usage of technology to create meaningful social impact. I believe that all students should grow up believing that computer science is a field for them, and they should understand that computer science can serve as a tool no matter what their interests- whether they love playing basketball, exploring the wilderness, or researching unicorns. My experience on the teaching team has taught me a lot about practices that can be employed to accomplish this goal and encourage more students to realize the potential of computer science.

Teaching middle school students isn’t always easy, and my co-teachers and I have learned a lot through both our successes and our failures. Reflection is a key part of our teaching process, and we rely on both discussion-based reflections and written reflections to iterate on our curriculum and our methods in the classroom. With my first semester as a teacher coming to a close, I’ve found that my reflections indicate clear successful practices and clear opportunities for improvement. One of our methodologies which I’ve found to be the most successful is explaining concepts outside of the context of computer science before using them to code. One of our greatest successes with this approach was in a lesson plan where we taught students about algorithms. For the purpose of this lesson, we defined an algorithm as "a series of steps used to accomplish a goal". To teach this to our students, we utilized two key strategies: we first had the students complete an obstacle course in pairs, where one student was a “turtle” and one was the “programmer”. The programmer had to give the turtle very specific instructions to get the turtle to the finish line- these instructions were the “algorithm” the programmer was writing for the computer. After completing this physical activity, we then taught the students how to use the turtle tool to draw images in Code.org’s AppLab (the platform we have them develop apps in). The turtle activity makes use of experiential learning, a technique that allows students to learn through interactive experiences. In a survey conducted by Signal Hill Group, approximately 92% of teachers indicated that experiential learning was effective for motivating students to learn and raising student achievement.

![image alt text](image_0.png)

My reflection from that day clearly mirrors this support of experiential learning and provides some insight into what was so effective: "Today was a really great day! It was super fun getting to start actually working in AppLab with the students, and they all seemed very engaged and excited about drawing different shapes in AppLab. As someone who’s never taught this lesson plan before, I was really excited about the turtle activity. I thought it was a great way to engage the students in an activity that very clearly translated to the programming tasks. In addition, that activity seemed to clearly help them think about the algorithms they had to use to draw different shapes."

My reflection makes it clear that the combination of these two activities, which were both appealing to a variety of students (all middle school kids, regardless of academic interests, can enjoy completing obstacle courses and drawing pictures), formed a strong basis for our course. In addition, students were able to see how computer science concepts can apply more broadly to the world in general, not just to coding. To this day, "algorithm" is one of the first terms that comes to mind when students are asked about terms they’ve learned in class.

While our experience teaching about algorithms demonstrates a successful lesson that incorporated real-world applications and coding experience, we have also had many lessons that were less successful than we had hoped. One concept that we struggled to teach our students is the idea of a "variable". One issue is that we did not have a clear definition going into class, as opposed to algorithm, which we had clearly defined. This flaw will definitely be addressed in future curriculum iterations. Our larger issue, however, was that the interactive activities we used did not translate as clearly to code as the turtle activity. We used two activities to teach variables: first, we wrote a poem on the board that had a student’s name in it and kept erasing and rewriting the poem for each student. Eventually, the students realized that we were only changing their names, and we introduced the idea of a variable called “name” that could be used instead. Then, students drew their own robots with variables robotName, robotHeight, and robotJob. Each student wrote the value of these variables on different index cards that we put in envelopes with the variable names. We then completed a MadLibs-style activity where we had blanks for different variable values and had to choose a value from the envelope.

My reflection after this lesson was not nearly as positive: "Today was a pretty frustrating day for me… I thought that overall the lesson plan was well-organized and the different variable activities were a fun way to introduce the idea of variables, but I think they’re a hard concept to teach/explain, especially without the code basis," I wrote. In our discussions following the lesson plan, I was able to clearly articulate these ideas to my co-teachers, as I had already spent some time reflecting personally. I presented the idea that variables might be best taught through coding experience, and we discussed future iterations of the curriculum which would allow students to view variables in code before completing hands-on activities. While I initially left this class session feeling frustrated, our reflective and iterative process allowed me to funnel that frustration into concrete next steps.

These experiences indicate that a combination of coding examples and hands-on activities is the most effective way to teach computer science, yet the dynamics between these two approaches cannot remain constant across lesson plans. It is important to think critically about which concepts should be grounded more strongly in coding and which concepts should initially be taught with hands-on examples. By incorporating both of these aspects, however, students will be empowered to use the concepts they learn in their everyday lives, and they will realize that computer science has broader applications than just coding. By utilizing this methodology and incorporating reflection and feedback into our process, CSbyUs is working to develop mindful, student-oriented approaches to computer science education which cater to all students. Through sustained partnership, reflection, and development, we will be able to foster a community of people working together to achieve this goal.

          summary: `Educators in elementary computer science face a lack of adaptable curricula. Because of this, the call for more modifiable, non-rigid curricula is enticing—assuming that such curricula could benefit teachers by increasing their ability to mold resources for individual classrooms and, ultimately, produce better teaching experiences and learning outcomes.
          Our team at CSbyUs noticed this scarcity, and we’ve created an open source web platform to facilitate more flexible, adaptable, and tested curricula for computer science educators.`,

`**The Problem**

There is an interesting tie between teaching and curriculum. Teachers often experience challenges in the classroom around how the curriculum works with a range of diverse students with different skill sets. Often times, teachers are not able to modify curriculum at a structural level meaning that the challenges they experience are not readily communicated to the greater community of educators to address challenges and find support and solutions. This phenomenon may lead to continued issues in teaching lessons effectively and efficiently to students.

**Foundations: Teachers in the curriculum-making process**

In the case of volunteer CS educator Hayley Barton, she actively works on both sides of the balance as a member of a teaching team and a curriculum-making team. Talking to Hayley, she illustrates some of the challenges experienced in the classroom when teaching computer science curriculum as well as how she adapts to those challenges through having a hand in the curriculum-making process. In describing her experience on both sides of the balance, Hayley illustrates the process and important advantage of teachers being able to notice challenges in the classroom, communicate those challenges, and be able to make modifications.

It is important that Hayley’s classroom implements this process of learning from teaching and being able to use that experience to influence her curriculum-making, which will eventually be administered in other classroom spaces. What Hayley is doing will influence other classroom spaces and other teachers. This illustrates on a small scale the kind of empowerment teachers can gain from having ownership over curriculum-making on a larger scale.

**Large-scale platform: Teachers commenting on their experience and sharing with one another**

That’s where the CSByUs platform comes in handy. The CSByUs platform is an open-source forum where teachers not only find student-oriented curriculum, but can have a hand in the curriculum-making process through iterating upon curriculum and accessing curriculum that has been iterated upon by other teachers.  It creates this database of curriculum that has continued to be iteratively modified upon; thus, teachers can pull from the database to transfer to their classrooms and can add their own modifications to the collective. Through this act, teachers are enabled to comment on their experience and why they have made certain modifications. In this way, other educators can join the conversation and teachers can support one another to come to solutions and better curriculum.

**Implications :**

It is extremely important that teachers can have more command and ownership in shapeshifting their classrooms by having a platform that supports them. But first, it’s important that we can notice and identify this success through learning about the challenges through the classroom experiences of current CS educators, like what Hayley Barton does. This is even more important when conjoined with the fact that Hayley does work in classrooms with primarily underrepresented demographics in computer science. The importance of CS education is to impart to students that computer science is for them, they can find personal connection to it and increase their sense of accessibility to the field of computer science. The fact that Hayley is a volunteer CS educator further encourages that anyone can use the platform to spread CS education--every parent, community leader, and educator can be empowered as a teacher.

Find out more about Hayley Barton’s teaching experience below:

**Me: Can you tell me a little bit about your experience teaching?**

**Hayley: **Student U is an organization in Durham and its mission is to get more underrepresented students and students from lower socio-economic background to graduate from high school and also from college. So at Student U you start participating in the program from middle school and it follows you up through high school, but if you go to college, they continue working with you in college. In order to be in the program you have to be on free and reduced lunch and/or be a first generation college student. 98-99% of their students are students of color, primarily black and African American students and latino students.

The goal is trying to expose the students to more computer science. One of the issues is that certain groups of people by gender, race and ethnic background are very underrepresented in computer science fields. So this is about trying to encourage that interest in computer science so that they understand or find out that this is something they could go into and is interesting and relevant from an early age.

[On the curriculum team,] there are different sorts of formats that we try to build into curriculum that make it particularly effective for students. Right now for Student U, we’re doing twice a week for 45 minutes each time in more of an afterschool club format, but then with Boys and Girls Club it would be once a week for an hour. With Citizens Schools it would actually be going on inside the classroom itself. The curriculum team doesn’t work directly with students. We develop the curriculum plans that the teachers are then going to go use in the classrooms.

With the teaching team, it is more concerned with the day-to-day teaching of a curriculum to the students that we’re currently working with.  We go into Student U with usually 10-12 students that we work with. We are introducing students to the field of computer science and getting them more interested in it. We are teaching computer science but also trying to tie in other strategies that have been shown to be effective like social-emotional learning and other skills that students need to excel, so teaching them how to do teamwork and collaboration among other things.

**Me: Do you find that your teaching influences your curriculum making or vice versa?**

**Hayley: **As a teaching team, there are definitely times when we struggle. I almost feel like there hasn’t been enough emphasis on the teaching team because there are definitely times when we struggle. I’ve worked with some students before in a tutoring capacity, but I don’t have a lot of background in that, so there are times when students are being disruptive or having some behavioral type of problems in the classroom. That experience where we’re trying really hard to get students understood but sometimes it’s not working definitely influences how I think about and how we build the curriculum.

Of course every classroom is different, so every time that this curriculum is taught to a new group the dynamics will be different and it’ll probably have to be changed a little bit. We are seeing the range of students that we work with and trying to make the curriculum be something that can be tailored to different students because we want to challenge every student without making it too challenging for any individual student. This is really hard because some of them are like superstars who are so advanced and doing amazing things on their app, and for some others  it’s hard to motivate them to focus and make one screen of their app. Thinking about those things definitely feeds into how I’m thinking about the curriculum in terms of making it accessible for all the students. The curriculum team influences my teaching. I think it’s just nice to have a better understanding of the curriculum when we’re teaching it. For instance, understanding why we have certain activities and knowing the flow of the curriculum help to give motivation for why we’re teaching it.

**Me: You brought up an interesting point about the range of students you can get in the classroom which is something teachers have to adapt to daily, can you say more about that?**:

**Hayley:** It’s something we’ve talked a lot about as the teaching team. Student U isn’t a school itself, it’s basically an after school and support program for students who attend other schools. This means by the time students show up at Student U for a couple hours after school not only are they coming from totally different family backgrounds and situations, but they also go to totally different schools. Each school has its own vibe and different expectations, and then of course every student is different. Bringing all of that together is, like, a lot of them are in different places or on different levels. We struggled with how to allocate our resources within the classroom, like if we have 5 or 6 teachers but there are some students who we want to give them attention individually or just take them off into a corner and really try to focus in on those students who seem to be having more trouble but there’s the question of, ‘how does that kind of detract from the classroom as a whole?’, and is it really fair if the majority of the teachers are distracted with one single student [rather than] the remainder of the students who probably also need support? If those other students have that one-on-one time themselves they could be doing even more amazing things with their apps. It’s hard to allocate teachers and resources making sure they’re all challenged without making anyone feel like they can’t do it when they’re all just completely different backgrounds and skill levels.

**Me: Is the curriculum you’re currently making being used in classrooms right now?**:

**Hayley:** In past semesters there had been a slightly different version of the curriculum. This had been used last year with Citizen Schools. This semester we’ve been working with Student U instead and since we have experience from past semesters about what sorts of activities seem to work well and didn’t work well we did an overhaul and revision of the curriculum… early on in the semester the curriculum changed and last year the curriculum team was working on that curriculum and then the teaching team would teach it for that semester, but now the curriculum team is done with the curriculum for Student U this semester and is now working on some of those other curriculum things I mentioned.

I think the goal is to have this kind of back and forth where the curriculum is something that’s been tested, where we’ve used our feedback, and also where we’ve used other research that we’ve done to make it something that’s actually impactful. I feel like we’ve gone through a lot of stages of development and there are still certain activities you do in the classroom and they still sort of just flop, which is a little disappointing but a lot of the things have gone well and a lot of the students are building really cool apps. They’re actually coming to Duke on November 29th; we have a big launch celebration where they get to show off the apps they’ve made. It’s also celebrating what it means to learn about computer science and learn these cool things. That’ll be really fun.

[Again] they are making really cool apps. One girl is making an app about the college search, so the idea is you can go on the app and search different colleges and get information about them and how to apply which is cool because a lot of the students at StudentU are first generation college students. Another student is making an app where students can review the teachers of Student U, kind of like a ratemyprofessors but for Student U. These are a little more difficult. We have another couple students making an app about Mexican food; there’s one about basketball, so there are definitely some different things. I think overall it has been good, and I think they’re warming up to it and getting more excited about their app, they definitely have kind of struggled with it during the semester to get them to focus on it depending on the activity and their level of interest in it.

**Me: Do you think your students genuinely enjoy what they’re doing and how do you think the tech that they’re working with and the tech things that they’re learning is impacting them?**

**Hayley: **I think one of the problems that we struggled with in the beginning is that when we go in to do this curriculum it’s during club time. There are a bunch of different clubs that one can do, such as arts and crafts and ultimate frisbee or the CSByUs app building. They get to rank the clubs, but I feel like a lot of the students that got picked to be in our club didn’t really want to be there and wanted to be in the other clubs instead, so that was kind of the dynamic we were working with which made it a little bit hard because it was hard to figure out how to motivate students that just seemed like they really didn’t want to be there. But I think over time as they’ve gotten more into their apps--like we’re really basically letting them make an app about whatever they want and whatever they’re interested in which I think makes them more excited about it.

I think, they are learning about how to make an app in App Lab, but there’s a more important type of learning we’re hoping they’re going to get. When you think about computer science, or at least me before I knew anything about it, I thought that it seemed really complicated and challenging, and I didn’t think it was something I would be able to do. I think importantly for a lot of students, after you’ve made an app you *are *a computer scientist. Coming to Duke they can the cool things that computer science can do even more than with the actual concepts we’re teaching them or how we’re teaching them to build an app. I think we’re hoping to inspire in them an interest in computer science and tech and hoping that if they do go into college-- like 90% of the students in the program do go on to graduate from college-- maybe they would consider doing computer science or a more technical field just because they feel like it’s more accessible or they feel like it’s something they can say they have a little bit of experience in.
