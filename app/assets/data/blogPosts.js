`As a Computer Science major at Duke and a teaching assistant for our Data Structures and Algorithms class, I feel that I have the opportunity to witness firsthand the way that exposure to computer science prior to college can affect students’ learning. For students without prior experience, there can be a steep learning curve when they get to college, and it is worsened by the fact that some of their peers have known the basics for years. This problem exists for all, but is especially prevalent for historically underrepresented groups in computing, such as women and people of color. With this blog post, I’m going to analyze exactly why we see this difference in prior experience and the long-term effects of a lack of early CS education and discuss how our team, CSbyUs, is trying to combat this.

As we go through the life of a student, I want you to keep in mind the analogy of the leaky STEM pipeline, a phenomenon commonly used to describe the loss of STEM students and workers as they progress through their education. This analogy hinges on the fact that at younger ages, people are interested in STEM fields, but over time, they go on to pursue other majors in college or careers upon graduating. To give an example, we can analyze The Chronicle’s discussion of women in computer science classes over time found [here](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2017/12/why-women-dont-stick-with-tech). For CS 101, an introductory class, the statistics are approximately half and half for men and women. The percentage of women drops about 10% for CS 201, the data structures and algorithms class. By the time students reach CS 230, a class required for the computer science major, the percentage drops to only about ¼ females. Even during the course of three computer science classes, the STEM pipeline experiences some pretty significant leaks. This implies that for some reason, when looking at higher level computer science classes, more and more women decide to stop pursuing computer science as a major. Why is this? As a female in computer science, I would probably say that it is a self-reinforcing problem. As I see less and less women in my CS classes, I become less and less motivated myself. This causes more women to drop CS, which in turn hurts others’ motivations. To fix this, it is necessary to provide support for underrepresented groups in CS to prevent this feeling of inadequacy and desire to drop out. But how do we even begin to approach that?

One of the main sources of this problem is the education gap, which is heavily tied into privilege. Our team read a chapter of ["Stuck In the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing"](https://www.amazon.com/Stuck-Shallow-End-Education-Computing/dp/0262514044) by Jane Margolis in which she analyzes the way that privilege and race affect stigma and accessibility of computer science education. During her paper, she categorizes schools as privileged and underprivileged. Privileged schools are generally defined to be those with more funding, better resources, and more skilled teachers, whereas underprivileged schools are in poorer areas, have less funding, and a significant lack of resources compared to other schools. Margolis found that in less privileged high schools, the teachers were less likely to be skilled in CS education and encourage students to pursue the field. Additionally, these schools also had less classes and equipment that was older and occasionally didn’t even work. This left many students feeling dissatisfied with their experience and unmotivated to continue on in the field. I believe that this lack of resources for certain groups directly influences what they pursue when they reach college or the workforce.

Margolis also took note that there was a certain stigma surrounding computer science students. For example, many students reported that a computer science student looked like a "white or asian nerdy guy" or similar descriptors. Because this typical description of a CS student is so limiting, many other individuals feel as if they are not cut out to be in CS because they don’t match a certain demographic. This directly correlates to some of our critically identified problems as a team: access and personal relevance. Access refers to general geography, access to money, and access to better resources/teachers. Personal relevance refers to students who feel disinterested in CS because the problems commonly discussed aren’t relevant to all groups.

In order to combat this, our team believes that it is necessary to create accessible and relatable CS education for all students starting at a young age. In doing this, it is possible to boost interest for younger students while also facilitating equality and breaking the stigma before it is even developed. We believe that we can maintain higher percentages of computer science students regardless of their demographic and even out the percentages of various groups in CS. By this point, you may be wondering why it even matters. Colleges give out plenty of CS degrees, we have CS workers, so why do we care? Well, it isn’t always that simple.

Going back to our leaky STEM pipeline, it is necessary to address the fact that although we have many CS majors, we don’t necessarily have enough members in the CS workforce. Those that we do have are very uniform, and fit closely within the confines of the aforementioned CS stereotype. In the United States, a large portion of professional careers is dedicated to STEM. However, there are not enough educated employees to fill these careers. For example, according to Jonathan Rothwell’s article ["Short on STEM Talent,"](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real) there are four million job vacancies in the computer science field, but there are only 40,000 Bachelor’s degrees in computer science earned annually. This is especially a problem noted for senior positions within CS. Although we seem to have many students studying computer science, it is a constantly growing field, and we want to continue supporting that growth.

Looking forward, I hope that one day Computer Science education can be accessible for all, and that we can remove the stigma surrounding studying CS. I think that with enough work on our part, we can encourage people from all backgrounds to study CS early on, which will in turn help lessen the steep learning curve in college and boost the STEM workforce as a whole. So far, we have already made a lot of progress toward this through teaching at schools in the local Durham community. During our lesson plans, students create apps with content that they choose, learn about fundamental concepts such as variables and algorithms, and more!

`There are many challenges plaguing the field of computer science education today, including issues of unequal access, teacher bias, and lack of qualified teachers. While some of these can be remedied more easily than others, great progress has been made in recent years to close these gaps and make computer science a field open to all. In spite of recent strides, a significant problem that persists is the need for a computer science curriculum that makes computer science feel relevant and comprehensible to all, regardless of background or academic interests. Even those who may not pursue a career in computer science can benefit from the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that computer science teaches. In addition, as technology becomes more deeply integrated in many facets of everyday life, computer literacy is becoming increasingly necessary, and these persistent problems in computer science education remain concerning. In order to address these issues, Duke undergraduates founded CSbyUs, a student-led initiative focused on broadening access to quality computer science education and igniting future change agents to transform their communities with tools developed through computer science education. There are three main components to this initiative: curriculum development, teaching, and technology development. I chose to join the teaching and technology teams because, as a computer science major and an education minor, I am passionate about both the importance of computer science education and the usage of technology to create meaningful social impact. I believe that all students should grow up believing that computer science is a field for them, and they should understand that computer science can serve as a tool no matter what their interests- whether they love playing basketball, exploring the wilderness, or researching unicorns. My experience on the teaching team has taught me a lot about practices that can be employed to accomplish this goal and encourage more students to realize the potential of computer science.

Teaching middle school students isn’t always easy, and my co-teachers and I have learned a lot through both our successes and our failures. Reflection is a key part of our teaching process, and we rely on both discussion-based reflections and written reflections to iterate on our curriculum and our methods in the classroom. With my first semester as a teacher coming to a close, I’ve found that my reflections indicate clear successful practices and clear opportunities for improvement. One of our methodologies which I’ve found to be the most successful is explaining concepts outside of the context of computer science before using them to code. One of our greatest successes with this approach was in a lesson plan where we taught students about algorithms. For the purpose of this lesson, we defined an algorithm as "a series of steps used to accomplish a goal". To teach this to our students, we utilized two key strategies: we first had the students complete an obstacle course in pairs, where one student was a “turtle” and one was the “programmer”. The programmer had to give the turtle very specific instructions to get the turtle to the finish line- these instructions were the “algorithm” the programmer was writing for the computer. After completing this physical activity, we then taught the students how to use the turtle tool to draw images in [Code.org’s AppLab](https://code.org/educate/applab) (the platform we have them develop apps in). The turtle activity makes use of experiential learning, a technique that allows students to learn through interactive experiences. In a [survey](https://www.juniorachievement.org/documents/20009/20652/Experiential_Learning_in_Education_March.pdf/a38b18d9-cdb5-46ee-a40f-7adc9f24da51) conducted by Signal Hill Group, approximately 92% of teachers indicated that experiential learning was effective for motivating students to learn and raising student achievement.

![ElizaGraph1](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MxX3fRFwPYl4DH_XGvVULxfwSyq0mtF9_7JKtQ8etzziiPWsUisGoSiD2dCO-S9LK_nSV202O0nDWAu7vse9_mP26A2AjYponS3VfPRT=s1469)

My reflection from that day clearly mirrors this support of experiential learning and provides some insight into what was so effective: "Today was a really great day! It was super fun getting to start actually working in AppLab with the students, and they all seemed very engaged and excited about drawing different shapes in AppLab. As someone who’s never taught this lesson plan before, I was really excited about the turtle activity. I thought it was a great way to engage the students in an activity that very clearly translated to the programming tasks. In addition, that activity seemed to clearly help them think about the algorithms they had to use to draw different shapes."

My reflection makes it clear that the combination of these two activities, which were both appealing to a variety of students (all middle school kids, regardless of academic interests, can enjoy completing obstacle courses and drawing pictures), formed a strong basis for our course. In addition, students were able to see how computer science concepts can apply more broadly to the world in general, not just to coding. To this day, "algorithm" is one of the first terms that comes to mind when students are asked about terms they’ve learned in class.

While our experience teaching about algorithms demonstrates a successful lesson that incorporated real-world applications and coding experience, we have also had many lessons that were less successful than we had hoped. One concept that we struggled to teach our students is the idea of a "variable". One issue is that we did not have a clear definition going into class, as opposed to algorithm, which we had clearly defined. This flaw will definitely be addressed in future curriculum iterations. Our larger issue, however, was that the interactive activities we used did not translate as clearly to code as the turtle activity. We used two activities to teach variables: first, we wrote a poem on the board that had a student’s name in it and kept erasing and rewriting the poem for each student. Eventually, the students realized that we were only changing their names, and we introduced the idea of a variable called “name” that could be used instead. Then, students drew their own robots with variables robotName, robotHeight, and robotJob. Each student wrote the value of these variables on different index cards that we put in envelopes with the variable names. We then completed a MadLibs-style activity where we had blanks for different variable values and had to choose a value from the envelope.

My reflection after this lesson was not nearly as positive: "Today was a pretty frustrating day for me… I thought that overall the lesson plan was well-organized and the different variable activities were a fun way to introduce the idea of variables, but I think they’re a hard concept to teach/explain, especially without the code basis," I wrote. In our discussions following the lesson plan, I was able to clearly articulate these ideas to my co-teachers, as I had already spent some time reflecting personally. I presented the idea that variables might be best taught through coding experience, and we discussed future iterations of the curriculum which would allow students to view variables in code before completing hands-on activities. While I initially left this class session feeling frustrated, our reflective and iterative process allowed me to funnel that frustration into concrete next steps.

These experiences indicate that a combination of coding examples and hands-on activities is the most effective way to teach computer science, yet the dynamics between these two approaches cannot remain constant across lesson plans. It is important to think critically about which concepts should be grounded more strongly in coding and which concepts should initially be taught with hands-on examples. By incorporating both of these aspects, however, students will be empowered to use the concepts they learn in their everyday lives, and they will realize that computer science has broader applications than just coding. By utilizing this methodology and incorporating reflection and feedback into our process, CSbyUs is working to develop mindful, student-oriented approaches to computer science education which cater to all students. Through sustained partnership, reflection, and development, we will be able to foster a community of people working together to achieve this goal.

*No two computer science students are alike—so teachers need curricula that are open and adaptable.*

Educators in elementary computer science face a lack of adaptable curricula. Calls for more modifiable, non-rigid curricula are therefore enticing—assuming that such curricula could benefit teachers by increasing their ability to mold resources for individual classrooms and, ultimately, produce better teaching experiences and learning outcomes.

Our team at [CSbyUs](https://csbyus.herokuapp.com/) noticed this scarcity, and we've created an open source web platform to facilitate more flexible, adaptable, and tested curricula for computer science educators. The mission of the CSbyUs team has always been utilizing open source technology to improve pedagogy in computer science, which includes increasing support for teachers. Therefore, this project primarily seeks to use open source principles—and the benefits inherent in them—to expand the possibilities of modern curriculum-making and support teachers by increasing access to more adaptable curricula.

**Rigid, monotonous, mundane**

Why is the lack of adaptable curricula a problem for computer science education? Rigid curricula dominates most classrooms today, primarily through monotonous and routinely distributed lesson plans. Many of these plans are developed without the capacity for dynamic use and application to different classroom atmospheres. In contrast, an adaptable curriculum is one that would account for dynamic and changing classroom environments.

An adaptable curriculum means freedom and more options for educators. This is especially important in elementary-level classrooms, where instructors are introducing students to computer science for the first time, and in classrooms with higher populations of groups typically underrepresented in the field of computer science. Here especially, it's advantageous for instructors to have access to curricula that explicitly consider diverse classroom landscapes and grants the freedom necessary to adapt to specific student populations.

**Making it adaptable**

This kind of adaptability is certainly at work at CSbyUs. Hayley Barton—a member of both the organization's curriculum-making team and its teaching team, and a senior at Duke University majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Science and Spanish—recently demonstrated the benefits of adaptable curricula during an engagement in the field. Reflecting on her teaching experiences, Barton describes a major reason why curriculum adaptation is necessary in computer science classrooms. "We are seeing the range of students that we work with," she says, "and trying to make the curriculum something that can be tailored to different students."

A more adaptable curriculum is necessary for truly challenging students, Barton continues.

The need for change became most evident to Barton when working students to make their own preliminary apps. Barton collaborated with students who appeared to be at different levels of focus and attention. On the one hand, a group of more advanced students took well to the style of a demonstrative curriculum and remained attentive and engaged to the task. On the other hand, another group of students seemed to have more trouble focusing in the classroom or even being motivated to engage with topics of computer science skills. Witnessing this difference among students, it became important that curriculum would need to be adaptable in multiple ways to be able to engage more students at their level.

"We want to challenge every student without making it too challenging for any individual student," Barton says. "Thinking about those things definitely feeds into how I'm thinking about the curriculum in terms of making it accessible for all the students."

As a curriculum-maker, she subsequently uses experiences like this to make changes to the original curriculum.

"If those other students have one-on-one time themselves, they could be doing even more amazing things with their apps," says Barton.

Taking this advice, Barton would potentially incorporate into the curriculum more emphasis on cultivating students' sense of ownership in computer science, since this is important to their focus and productivity. For this, students may be afforded that sense of one-on-one time. The result will affect the next round of teachers who use the curriculum.

For these changes to be effective, the onus is on teachers to notice the dynamics of the classroom. In the future, curriculum adaptation may depend on paying particular attention to and identifying these subtle differences of style of curriculum. Identifying and commenting about these subtleties allows the possibility of applying a different strategy, and these are the changes that are applied to the curriculum.

"We've gone through a lot of stages of development," Barton says. "The goal is to have this kind of back and forth, where the curriculum is something that's been tested, where we've used our feedback, and also used other research that we've done, to make it something that's actually impactful."

Hayley's "back and forth" process is an iterative process of curriculum-making. Between utilizing curricula and modifying curricula, instructors like Hayley can take a once-rigid curriculum and mold it to any degree that the user sees fit—again and again. This iterative process depends on tests performed first in the classroom, and it depends on the teacher's rationale and reflection on how curricula uniquely pans out for them.

Adaptability of curriculum is the most important principle on which the CSbyUs platform is built. Much like Hayley's process of curriculum-making, curriculum adaptation should be iterative, as it involves learning from experience, returning to the drawing board, making changes, and finally, utilizing the curriculum again. Once launched, the CSbyUS website will document this iterative process.

The open-focused pedagogy behind the CSbyUs platform, then, brings to life the flexibility inherent in the process of curriculum adaptation. First, it invites and collects the valuable first-hand perspectives of real educators working with real curricula to produce real learning. Next, it capitalizes on an iterative processes of development—one familiar to open source programmers—to enable modifications to curriculum (and the documentation of those modifications). Finally, it transforms the way teachers encounter curricula by helping them make selections from different versions of both modified curriculum and "the original." Our platform's open source strategy is crucial to cultivating a hub of flexible curricula for educators.

Open source practices can be a key difference in making rigid curricula more moldable for educators. Furthermore, since this approach effectively melds open source technologies with open-focused pedagogy, open pedagogy can potentially provide flexibility for educators teaching various curriculum across disciplines.

*CSbyUs Tech R&D team’s workflow and special sauces*

I'm lucky to work with a team of impressive students at Duke University who are leaders in their classrooms and beyond. As members of CSbyUs, a non-profit and student-run organization based at Duke, we connect university students to middle school students, mostly from [title I schools](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/titleiparta/index.html) across North Carolina's Research Triangle Park. Our mission is to fuel future change agents from under-resourced learning environments by fostering critical technology skills for thriving in the digital age.

The CSbyUs Tech R&D team (TRD for short) recently set an ambitious goal to build and deploy a powerful web application over the course of one fall semester. Our team of six knew we had to do something about our workflow to ship a product by winter break. In our middle school classrooms, we teach our learners to use agile methodologies and design thinking to create mobile applications. On the TRD team, we realized we needed to practice what we preach in those classrooms to ship a quality product by semester's end.


This is the story of how and why we utilized the principles we teach our students in order to deploy technology that will scale our mission and make our teaching resources open and accessible.

**Setting the scene**

For the past two years, CSbyUs has operated "on the ground," connecting Duke undergraduates to Durham middle schools via after-school programming. After teaching and evaluating several iterations of our unique, student-centered mobile app development curriculum, we saw promising results. Our middle schoolers were creating functional mobile apps, connecting to their mentors, and leaving the class more confident in their computer science skills. Naturally, we wondered how to expand our programming.

We knew we should take our own advice and lean into web-based technologies to share our work, but we weren't immediately sure what problem we needed to solve. Ultimately, we decided to create a web app that serves as a centralized hub for open source and open access digital education curricula. "CurriculaHub" (name inspired by GitHub) would be the defining pillar of CSbyUs's new website, where educators could share and adapt resources.

But the vision and implementation didn't happen overnight.

Given our sense of urgency and the potential of "CurriculaHub," we wanted to start this project with a well defined plan. The stakes were (and are) high, so planning, albeit occasionally tedious, was critical to our success. Like the curriculum we teach, we scaffolded our workflow process with design thinking and agile methodology, two critical 21st century frameworks we often fail to practice in higher ed.

What follows is a step-wise explanation of our design thinking process, starting from inspiration and ending in a shipped prototype.

**Our Process**

**Step 1: Pre-Work**

In order to understand the *why* to some of our *what*, you have to know *who* are team is.

The members of this team are busy. All of us contribute to CSbyUs beyond our TRD-related responsibilities. As an organization with lofty goals beyond creating a web-based platform, we have to reconcile our "on the ground" commitments (i.e., curriculum curation, research and evaluation, mentorship training and practice, presentations at conferences, etc.) with our "in the cloud" technological goals.

In addition to balancing time across our organization, we have to be flexible in the ways we communicate. As a remote member of the team, I'm writing this post from Spain, but the rest of our team is based in North Carolina, adding collaboration challenges.

Before diving into development (or even problem identification), we knew we had to set some clear expectations for how we'd operate as a team. We took a note from our curriculum team's book and started with some [rules of engagement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqV6B6Uk-QB7Psj1rX9tfCyW3E64_v6xDlhRZ-L2rq0/edit). This is actually a [well-documented approach](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/rules-of-engagement) to setting up a team's [social contract](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/social-contract/) used by teams across the tech space. During a summer internship at IBM, I remember pre-project meetings where my manager and team spent more than an hour clarifying principles of interaction. Whenever we faced uncertainty in our team operations, we'd pull out the rules of engagement and clear things up almost immediately. (An aside: I've found this strategy to be wildly effective not only in my teams, but in all relationships).

Considering the remote nature of our team, one of our favorite tools is Slack. We use it for almost everything. We can't have sticky-note brainstorms, so we create Slack brainstorm threads. In fact, that's exactly what we did to generate our rules of engagement. [One open source principle we take to heart](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition) is *transparency*; Slack allows us to archive and openly share our thought processes and decision-making steps with the rest of our team.

**Step 2: Empathy Research**

We're all here for unique reasons, but we find a common intersection: the desire to broaden equity in access to quality digital era education.

Each member of our team has been lucky enough to study at Duke. We know how it feels to have limitless opportunities and the support of talented peers and renowned professors. But we're mindful that this isn't normal. Across the country and beyond, these opportunities are few and far between. Where they do exist, they're confined within the guarded walls of higher institutes of learning or come with a lofty price tag.

While our team members' common desire to broaden access is clear, we work hard to root our decisions in research. So our team begins each semester [reviewing](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/images-of-computer-science-report.pdf) [research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iK0ZRAXVwGX9owtjUUjNz3_2kbyYZ79/view?usp=sharing) that justifies our existence. TRD works with CRD (curriculum research and development) and TT (teaching team), our two other CSbyUs sub-teams, to discuss current trends in digital education access, their systemic roots, and novel approaches to broaden access and make materials relevant to learners. We not only perform research collaboratively at the beginning of the semester but also implement weekly stand-up research meetings with the sub-teams. During these, CRD often presents new findings we've gleaned from interviewing current teachers and digging into the current state of access in our local community. They are our constant source of data-driven, empathy-fueling research.

Through this type of empathy-based research, we have found that educators interested in student-centered teaching and digital era education lack a centralized space for proven and adaptable curricula and lesson plans. The bureaucracy and rigid structures that shape classroom learning in the United States makes reshaping curricula around the personal needs of students daunting and seemingly impossible. As students, educators, and technologists, we wondered how we might unleash the creativity and agency of others by sharing our own resources and creating an online ecosystem of support.

**Step 3: Defining the Problem**

We wanted to avoid [scope creep](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/top-five-causes-scope-creep-6675) caused by a poorly defined mission and vision (something that happens too often in some organizations). We needed structures to define our goals and maintain clarity in scope. Before imagining our application features, we knew we'd have to start with defining our north star. We would generate a clear problem statement to which we could refer throughout development.

This is common practice for us. Before committing to new programming, new partnerships, or new changes, the CSbyUs team always refers back to our mission and vision and asks, "Does this make sense?" (in fact, we post our mission and vision to the top of every meeting minutes document). If it fits and we have capacity to pursue it, we go for it. And if we don't, then we don't. In the case of a "no," we are always sure to document what and why because, as engineers know, [detailed logs are almost always a good decision](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42354/The-Art-of-Logging#what). TRD gleaned that big-picture wisdom and implemented a group-defined problem statement to guide our sub-team mission and future development decisions.

To formulate a single, succinct problem statement, we each began by posting our own takes on the problem. Then, during one of our weekly [30-minute-no-more-no-less stand-up meetings](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/2/6-steps-running-perfect-30-minute-meeting), we identified commonalities and differences, ultimately [merging all our ideas into one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdPRvFhMKPCrwOG2CGp7kP4rKOXrJKI77CgjMfaaXnk/edit?usp=sharing). Boiled down, we identified that *there exist massive barriers for educators, parents, and students to share, modify, and discuss open source and accessible curricula*. And of course, our mission would be to break down those barriers with user-centered technology. This "north star" lives as a highly visible document in our Google Drive, which has influenced our feature prioritization and future directions.

**Step 4: Ideating a Solution**

With our problem defined and our rules of engagement established, we were ready to imagine a solution.

We believe that effective structures can ensure meritocracy and community. Sometimes, certain personalities dominate team decision-making and leave little space for collaborative input. To avoid that pitfall and maximize our equality of voice, we tend to use "offline" individual brainstorms and merge collective ideas online. It's the same process we used to create our rules of engagement and problem statement. In the case of ideating a solution, we started with "offline" brainstorms of three [S.M.A.R.T. goals](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/how-to-create-smart-goals). Those goals would be ones we could achieve as a software development team (specifically because the CRD and TT teams offer different skill sets) and address our problem statement. Finally, we wrote these goals in a meeting minutes document, clustering common goals and ultimately identifying themes that describe our application features. In the end, we identified three: support, feedback, and open source curricula.

From here, we divided ourselves into sub-teams, repeating the goal-setting process with those teams—but in a way that was specific to our features. And if it's not obvious by now, we realized a web-based platform would be the most optimal and scalable solution for supporting students, educators, and parents by providing a hub for sharing and adapting proven curricula.

To work efficiently, we needed to be adaptive, reinforcing structures that worked and eliminating those that didn't. For example, we put a lot of effort in crafting meeting agendas. We strive to include *only* those subjects we must discuss in-person and table everything else for offline discussions on Slack or individually organized calls. We practice this in real time, too. During our regular meetings on Google Hangouts, if someone brings up a topic that isn't highly relevant or urgent, the current stand-up lead (a role that rotates weekly) "parking lots" it until the end of the meeting. If we have space at the end, we pull from the parking lot, and if not, we reserve that discussion for a Slack thread.

This prioritization structure has led to massive gains in meeting efficiency and a focus on progress updates, shared technical hurdle discussions, collective decision-making, and assigning actionable tasks (the next-steps a person has committed to taking, documented with their name attached for everyone to view).

**Step 5: Prototyping**

This is where the fun starts.

Given our requirements—like an interactive user experience, the ability to collaborate on blogs and curricula, and the ability to receive feedback from our users—we began identifying the best technologies. Ultimately, we decided to build our web app with a ReactJS frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. We chose these due to the extensive documentation and active community for both, and the well-maintained libraries that bridge the relationship between the two (e.g., react-on-rails). Since we chose Rails for our backend, it was obvious from the start that we'd work within a Model-View-Controller framework.

Most of us didn't have previous experience with web development, neither on the frontend nor the backend. So, getting up and running with either technology independently presented a steep learning curve, and gluing the two together only steepened it. To centralize our work, we use an open-access GitHub repository. Given our relatively novice experience in web development, our success hinged on extremely efficient and open collaborations.

And to explain that, we need to revisit the idea of structures. Some of ours include peer code reviews—where we can exchange best-practices and reusable solutions, maintaining up-to-date tech and user documentation so we can look back and understand design decisions—and (my personal favorite) our questions bot on Slack, which gently reminds us to post and answer questions in a separate Slack #questions channel.

We've also dabbled with other strategies, like instructional videos for generating basic React components and rendering them in Rails Views. I tried this and in my first video, [I covered a basic introduction to our repository structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52kvV0plW1E) and best practices for generating React components. While this proved useful, our team has since realized the wealth of online resources that document various implementations of these technologies robustly. Also, we simply haven't had enough time (but we might revisit them in the future—stay tuned).

We're also excited about our cloud-based implementation. We use Heroku to host our application and manage data storage. In next iterations, we plan to both expand upon our current features and configure a continuous iteration/continuous development pipeline using services like Jenkins integrated with GitHub.

**Step 6: Testing**

Since we've just deployed, we are now in a testing stage. Our goals are to collect user feedback across our feature domains and our application experience as a whole, especially as they interact with our specific audiences. Given our original constraints (namely, time and people power), this iteration is the first of many to come. For example, future iterations will allow for individual users to register accounts and post external curricula directly on our site without going through the extra steps of email. We want to scale and maximize our efficiency, and that's part of the recipe we'll deploy in future iterations. As for user testing: We collect user feedback via our contact form, via informal testing within our team, and via structured focus groups. [We welcome your constructive feedback and collaboration](https://csbyus.herokuapp.com/joinus).

Our team was *only* able to unite new people with highly varied experience through the power of *open* principles and methodologies. Luckily enough, each one I described in this post is adaptable to virtually every team.

Regardless of whether you work—on a software development team, in a classroom, or, heck, [even in your family](https://opensource.com/open-organization/15/11/what-our-families-teach-us-about-organizational-life)—principles like transparency and community are almost always the best foundation for a successful organization.

One of [today’s best careers](https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/slideshows/the-25-best-jobs?onepage) is software developing or software engineering. As our world becomes more and more digitized, the need for people to build and manage these computers is growing. Across media, there are calls for an increase in diversity in the tech industry. According to [an article by TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/), there are half as many Latinx and African-American individuals in tech than the rest of the private sector. Even more shocking, 82% of tech executives are white while Latinos and African-Americans only make up less than 5% of these.

This disparity can be seen even among computer science majors. In a graph taken from an [article by Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/), we can see white men dominate in terms of majoring in computer science, while other groups (even white women) have experienced a dip.

Although CS is likely to be offered in a university setting, the same thing cannot be said of K-12 schools. According to a report by Google, ["Trends in State of Computer Science in U.S. K-12 Schools"](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/trends-in-the-state-of-computer-science-report.pdf), schools offer computer science opportunities less than 40% of the time. In Durham, North Carolina, my individual searches have shown that there are not many opportunities for students to take CS courses, especially for those who are minorities or low-income. Another report by Google, [“Diversity Gaps in Computer Science: Exploring the Underrepresentation of Girls, Blacks and Hispanic”](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/diversity-gaps-in-computer-science-report.pdf), highlights the unique challenges that students of color face. For example, “Black students are less likely than White students to have classes dedicated to CS at the school they attend” and “Black and Hispanic students are less likely than White students to use a computer at home at least most days of the week”.

There have been several ways that we can see the impact of this lack of diversity and pipelines for people of color into the tech industry. A [viral video](https://twitter.com/nke_ise/status/897756900753891328) uploaded by a Nigerian man who works at Facebook comes to mind as a fitting example. In the video, you can see the man try to get soap from an automatic dispenser, but the apparatus fails to sense his hand. However, his friend with a light-skinned hand has no problem getting the dispenser to recognize him. Evidently, this soap dispenser was programmed and tested by White individuals or otherwise there would have been awareness of its malfunction.

Another incident that indicates this disparity is when search engines return problematic terms. In her book [*Algorithms of Oppression*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Oppression-Search-Engines-Reinforce/dp/1479837245), Safiya Noble recalls a time when she Google searched the term "black girls" and was returned various sexualized images of Black women including links to pornographic websites. Consequently, Google apologized but addressed it as a “bug”, when in reality it was poor management on the company’s end to assure their products and services are built for everyone.

There are consequences through which this lack of diversity affects disadvantaged communities as well. The most obscure one is through the negligence of solutions to issues within those communities. One of my acquaintances who attends Stanford University participated in a hackathon where she built a chatbot that answered questions about Medicaid. Her motivation was her family’s dependence on Medicaid when she was growing up. Her family often lacked the information necessary to renew benefits as well as answers to questions that came up. She ended up winning an award for her work. Issues like those around Medicaid are isolated to the communities who face them, the same communities that are not represented in tech. This means that improvements to their lives that can be easily fixed by a technological innovation are left unnoticed or unaddressed.

Although these incidents may seem like small issues, they can have dangerous implications as they are indicative of a larger issue within the tech industry and society as a whole. The search engine example indicates how tech can perpetuate existing stereotypes and prejudices surrounding Black women. Tech is purposefully leaving people of color behind and advancing innovations that are beneficial to only those who have the means to achieve and those who are working on the innovations themselves.

Our research team, CSbyUs, was founded in an effort to help relieve some of these issues within CS education in the United States. Using [a curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HhURHo2u9WwidZ83Px70qQ8U8411ClAh--IZ4Oxz20/edit?usp=sharing) designed by my research peers, we teach students at a program by the name of [Student U](https://studentudurham.org/), that serves low-income minority students. We teach them fundamental concepts to help them build their own mobile application on [Code.org’s AppLab](https://code.org/educate/applab). These concepts are not only technical but also focused on fostering the students’ identity as computer scientists. Additionally, we stress that the apps should be based on their interests and be impactful for their community. One way that our work is different from that of other organizations is that we place a focus on open-sourcing. Open-source means that the curriculum is online and free to use as one pleases. Because most people who need a CS curriculum are likely to not be tech-savvy, we are also focusing on UI/UX to allow the experience to be smooth and simple.

Other ways that CS education is expanding into disadvantaged communities is through efforts like [Google For Education](https://edu.google.com/k-12-solutions/) and UCLA’s [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/) (ECS) curriculum. Google For Education’s focus is to utilize technology in order to alleviate inequities in education. One way that they have done this is through the release of their Chromebook, a laptop/tablet that is purposefully affordable for disadvantaged communities. School districts across the nation have acquired hundreds of these laptops for their students. In my high school’s district, an effort by the name of 1:1 was started in order to help give each student a Chromebook. Although successful, the district has failed to train teachers and students on how to harness the power of having a laptop. From anecdotes I have obtained, it seems that most students are not comfortable with their knowledge on how to use the devices. UCLA’s program is a curriculum designed by two researchers that has been adopted by Code.org as one of their core courses. The mission of ECS is help improve the state of CS education, specifically in underserved schools with high numbers of Latinx, Black and female students.

So what does giving an enhanced CS education to underrepresented students mean for the future of the tech industry?

One obvious outcome is that there will be more minorities entering the tech industry. This means that issues that only minorities and low-income individuals face will be represented in and addressed by tech. Issues that have been oppressing marginalized communities will finally be addressed, and allow these communities to prosper. The tech industry will also boom if CS education was more equitable. Minority communities are an untapped resource that will add tremendous capital to the industry, allowing them to grow like never before. Companies will be able to ship out new products that their non-diverse counterpart would have never addressed, leading to growths in product sales. Having diverse leadership will also allow these companies to explore different tactics, which may lead to benefits as well. ["Why Diversity Matters"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2016/08/29/why-diversity-matters-in-tech/#156d72aa8614), an article on Forbes, details various ways that diversity on the tech industry is beneficial:

* Diverse companies are more likely to have better financial return,

* Diversity increases the performance of teams within companies, and

* Companies are avoiding tapping into a wealth of talent that people of color offer

There are many benefits for making computer science education more equitable. Whether it be economic growth for companies or improvement in lifestyle for marginalized communities, diversity as a goal is something that should be important to any company.
